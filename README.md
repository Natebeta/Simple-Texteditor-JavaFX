# Simple-Texteditor-JavaFX
Counts words, counts characters, trims, saves and opens files (limited: .txt). 

Issues: When you remove the text, the Wordscounter get 1. Counts new words when you hit space.

It's a simple texteditor, because it should work as a basic notepad editor. The code is implemented in a MVC-Pattern which includes: one model with concept and the main functions, one controller to transfer data/reacton between user action & function model and one view with UI. The handler and listener are implemented in the controller.
